## Structure
A website dedicated to my idol Ru Paul Charles. This consolidated my understanding on HTML and CSS. I was able to use HTML5 and use a mobile first approach to ensure the page was responseive using media queries. I was able to experiment with flex and CSS grid to get the desired photo arrangements.

## Included features
- :heart: Semantic HTML
- :orange_heart: CSS grid 
- :yellow_heart: CSS flex
- :green_heart: Responsive design using media queries 
- :blue_heart: Font awesome icons
- :purple_heart: External font libary

## Improvements and futures ideas
- To attempt creating an image carousel (with JS) instead of current static design.
- Use transitions on links to make more interactive.
